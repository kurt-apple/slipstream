# Slipstream
Slipstream is a Directed-Graph-based todolist program. Users can create tasks in the list with an unlimited number of pre-requisites and post-requisites. Dependencies that become redundant are automatically pruned.
TODO:
- use Hash Tables for lists of prerequisites and postrequisites.
- various performance tweaks.
- design asynchronous multiuser functionality.
